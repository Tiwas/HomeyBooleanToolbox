# Smart (Components) Toolkit for Homey

> **Name Change:** This app was previously known as "Boolean Toolbox". The name was changed to "Smart (Components) Toolkit" to better reflect the expanded functionality beyond just boolean logic - now including state management, scene control, and flow utilities.

Advanced logic and state management for your Homey automations. Create smart devices that react to multiple inputs with customizable formulas, and manage device states with powerful capture/restore functionality.

## 📦 Device Types

### Logic Device

The easiest way to create boolean logic with a visual pairing wizard.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Visual pairing wizard - select zone → device → capability |
| **Inputs** | Dynamic (2-10, auto-expands based on formula) |
| **Formulas** | Single formula per device |
| **Best for** | Simple setups, beginners |

[📚 Read Logic Device guide →](https://tiwas.github.io/SmartComponentsToolkit/docs/devices.html)

---

### Logic Unit

Powerful device for advanced users who need multiple formulas or prefer JSON configuration.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Quick add with manual JSON configuration |
| **Inputs** | Dynamic (2-10, auto-expands based on formula) |
| **Formulas** | Multiple independent formulas per device |
| **Best for** | Advanced users, multi-formula needs |

*Note: Logic Unit X (2, 3, 4...10 inputs) are legacy devices with fixed input counts - use the new Logic Unit instead.*

---

### State Device

Capture and restore device states. Create "scenes" by storing the current state of multiple devices and applying them later with a single action.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Visual pairing wizard - select zones and devices |
| **Values** | Fixed at setup time |
| **Use case** | Predefined scenes (Movie Night, Cleaning, etc.) |

**Key features:**
- Capture current state of multiple devices across zones
- Apply stored state with a single flow action
- "Reset All" option to turn off other State Devices first
- Hierarchical execution with configurable delays

---

### State Capture Device (BETA)

Dynamic state capture with templates, named slots, and push/pop stack operations.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Visual pairing wizard - define template of devices/capabilities |
| **Values** | Captured at runtime (not fixed) |
| **Named states** | Store multiple named snapshots |
| **Stack** | Push/pop for temporary state management |

**Key features:**
- Capture current device states to named slots at runtime
- Push/pop stack for temporary state changes (e.g., doorbell interruption)
- Dynamic state names with Homey tokens support
- Max 50 named states, max 20 stack depth per device

**Example use case:**
```
WHEN: Doorbell rings
THEN: Push current state to stack
THEN: Set all lights to 100%
THEN: Wait 5 minutes
THEN: Pop state (restore previous)
```

---

### Waiter Gates (BETA)

**⚠️ Experimental feature** - Feedback welcome!

Waiter Gates let your flows pause and wait for device states to change, with YES/NO outputs:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wait condition** | Pause flow until device capability reaches target value |
| **YES path** | Value matches (or already matched) |
| **NO path** | Timeout expired before match |

**Flow Cards:**
- **Wait until device capability becomes value** *(condition)* - Waits with timeout
- **Control waiter gate** *(action)* - Enable/disable/stop a waiter by ID
- **Wait** *(action)* - Simple delay (basic pause without device monitoring)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add a Device

**Logic Device (recommended for beginners):**
- Go to **Devices** → **Add Device** → **Smart (Components) Toolkit** → **Logic Device**
- Follow the pairing wizard to select inputs
- Configure formula in device settings

**Other devices:**
- Logic Unit, State Device, State Capture Device - same process, different wizards

### 2. Write Formulas (Logic devices)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "formula_1",
    "name": "Motion & Dark",
    "expression": "A AND B",
    "enabled": true,
    "timeout": 60
  }
]
```

**Operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT` (plus `&`, `|`, `^`, `!`)

### 3. Use in Flows

```
WHEN: Formula [motion_detected] changed to TRUE
THEN: Turn on lights
```

## 🎮 Flow Cards

### Triggers (WHEN)
- Formula result changed to TRUE/FALSE
- Formula timed out
- State changed *(Logic Device only)*
- State was captured/applied *(State Capture Device)*

### Conditions (AND)
- Formula result is...
- Formula has timed out
- Captured state exists *(State Capture Device)*
- Stack is empty / Stack depth is... *(State Capture Device)*
- **Wait until device capability becomes value** *(Waiter Gates - BETA)*

### Actions (THEN)
- Set input value for formula
- Evaluate formula / Re-evaluate all
- Apply state *(State Device)*
- Capture/Apply/Delete state, Push/Pop/Peek/Clear stack *(State Capture Device)*
- **Control waiter gate** *(Waiter Gates - BETA)*
- **Wait** *(Simple delay)*

## 💡 Key Features

### Dynamic Input Expansion
Start with 2 inputs, grow to 10 automatically:
```json
{"expression": "A AND B AND C AND D"}
// Device auto-expands to 4 inputs!
```

### First Impression Mode
Lock inputs at first value for sequence-based logic:
```json
{"firstImpression": true, "timeout": 30}
```

### Multiple Independent Formulas (Logic Unit only)
Each formula maintains its own input states:
```json
[
  {"id": "day_mode", "expression": "A AND B"},
  {"id": "night_mode", "expression": "A OR B"}
]
```

### JSON Auto-Formatting
Paste ugly JSON, get beautiful formatting on save. Works in all settings fields.
