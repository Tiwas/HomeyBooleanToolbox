Create advanced, state-aware logic units for your Homey flows. Move beyond simple AND/OR cards and build powerful logic modules based on dynamic boolean expressions.

Standard Homey Flows are powerful, but creating complex logic can quickly become messy. If you have multiple conditions to check, you often end up with a web of logic cards that is hard to read, maintain, and debug.

Boolean Toolbox solves this by providing a virtual "Logic Unit" device. Instead of wiring together multiple cards, you define your entire logic in a single text-based expression. The device waits for all necessary input signals, evaluates the expression, and gives you a single, predictable true or false output.
